# Usage and Limitations

-You must have a MySQL server running with an existing database. Go to db.js and fill its credentials.
-There must be at least two users already registered, or the recognition wouldn't work and the app would crash.
-Whenever the server stops, all the recognition data are lost, and you will have to re-register the employees.
